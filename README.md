# Syncopath
A Sublime Text plugin for teams that uses firebase to track what files are being saved. When someone opens a file that someone else previously saved, you will receive a notification as to who saved the file last and when. This can help reduce merge conflicts, and provides insight as to who edited the file last if any questions arise.

#### Instructions.

- Create a firebase account.
- Copy your firebase url.
- Put the firebase url in the Syncopath.sublime-settings
